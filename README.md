Project heavily focused on creating CSS with SASS to have a visually appealing and responsive website. 
This project was my first step into learning SASS. 

I used VS CODE as my IDE. It has an extension for creating the CSS from SASS and launching the website.

Current Status:
There is still one bug I wasn't able to figure out. 
When the app is in mobile mode and you click on the Hamburger, there is supposed to be a menu that pops up. 
But the menu does not appear above the Hero's photos. 
I had narrow'd it down to the _Hero &__logo class being the problem. 
But not sure how to fix it yet.
